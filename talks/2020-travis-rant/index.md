## *Step 2* Stay Vague and Act Quickly

---

* Write a blog post, kinda, but...
* *Keep massive change hidden* behind PR Bla Bla
* Leave *no grace period*

* *Notify? Who cares!*

---

* Partial rollout, the way it is done
* *No announcement*
* Buggy progress bar
* Do not link resources for further help
* Once countdowns tick, your users will learn the hard way

# *Travis CI*, you had one job.

---

## *Step 5* Make Your Users Love the Little Things

---

## *For personal projects I went down the apply for free OSS plan path.*

#### Took three weeks to get a response after a comprehensive application from my side. They gave up and handed me 50000 prepaid credits without settling the case.

---

## *On the Camunda side we had credit card payment issues.*

#### They ended up charging us twice for additional credits (my bad). We asked for a refund but gave up eventually. Got plenty of credits to burn now.

## _One a Friday afternoon I prognosed that our free credits would last until Tuesday._

### Then we did start to build Camunda BPM Docker images on Travis in a project outside my sphere.
