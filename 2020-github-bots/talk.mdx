# Building GitHub Bots / Apps
...and the [bpmn.io](http://bpmn.io/) pull request flow.

---

## GitHub Bot / App

An application that consumes events (emitted by GitHub) and drives workflow via GitHub REST or GraphQL API.

---

## Examples

* Automate dependency update notifications
* Automate CI run scheduling
* Automate merged branch deletion
* Automate issue commenting / marking / closing
* Automate merging, once all required checks pass
* Rich user interaction via issues
* ...

## Flow

![flow](./resources/flow.svg)

---


## Event Subscription via Web Hooks

GitHub allows you to register web hooks, URLs that are being  invoked once anything happens.

---

## Driving GitHub via API

REST API (so 2017) or GraphQL API.

---

## Security Model

Apps are authenticated by organization owners on a per-project level.

Apps must declare consumed events and access to project and user resources on a fine grained level (i.e. _read issues_, _write issue comments_).

Apps may impersonate users (to a certain extend) to perform actions on behalf of the user.
