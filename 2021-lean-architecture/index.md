### Lean Architecture

* Evolve high level structure of your app, as you go
* Support new, emerging capabilities
* *Do what's necessary when it fits*
* :bulb: Get a sense of what's necessary (and when)

### Case Study: Sections

* Identify we are miss-using existing `Overlay` component
* Find a common denominator: A `Section` component that easily combines with `Overlay`
* [Fix what is necessary](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/pull/2571) :wrench:
* Consider the future: Unbuild legacy `Overlay` structure

### The _Rules of Refactoring_ Apply

:zero: Know what you want to do and why

:one: Separate refactoring from feature development

:two: Get buy in and improve substantially

:three: Clean up after you
