## _How does the engine work?_

#### A tale on computer systems, and how to work with them.

## _How does the engine work?_

---

## How does a computer work?

---

## How does a computer work?

* It takes *instructions*, and *executes* them
* It *does not guess*, it *does not discuss*
* It always worked that way; only recently propabalistic computing slightly changed it (see also [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model))

---

## What this means for humans operating it?

---

[![inexplicable](./inexplicable.png)](https://xkcd.com/1316/)

---

## The person in front of the computer is always (mostly!) wrong

---

## Why would you still use a computer?

---

## Why would you still use a computer?

* Because it only does the mistakes that you told it to do
* Because it can execute things at scale

---

## So again, what does the engine do?

---

## How _can_ a human program a Computer?

---

## How _can_ a human program a Computer?

* They have to know what they do and why
* They get (good) tools to support them, prevent silly errors
* They test things, diligently

---

## How do computers safe-guard users?

* Computers are often built to prevent grave consequences
  * If they fail (very unlikely; but for that matter a plane has at least two inside executing mission critical things)
  * If the users fail to operate it correctly

---

## What does the engine do?

* It allows you to program how processes are executed, and executes them at scale, if instructed to do so

---

## What does the engine do?

* It can be used at different stages (different criticality)
  * `development` stage, `testing` stage; screwing up there, intended to provide environments where human screw-ups don't cause grave consequences
  * `production`, where things matter, and are executed _at scale_

---

## What does the engine do?

* It forces you to make explicit _what is executed_

## Thanks
